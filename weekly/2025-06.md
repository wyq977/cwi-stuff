## Goals

* Create solid test cases for Two Proportion test
* Consolidate on github workflow and pre-commit workflow
* Present my master thesis Friday
* CONTINUED: Problems with unbalanced design
* Problems with 0.18, how to arrive that
* Simulation for Li's algorithm
* How to get nPlan (math), check safe testing paper
* Sedeq in safe testing paper
* What the hell is effect size
* algorithm for calculating power and nPlan
* Regular and non-regular exponential family
* NEF
* Check on pre-commit

### Problem 1:

when no restrictions have been placed on $(\theta_a, \theta_b)$, 

ya = yb = all 1s is completely different from all 0s

Why?

### Problem 2: (SOLVED? since the input dim. is wrong)

Running all 0s, changing group size will skew the e value slightly smaller than 1

Running all 1s, changing group will increase the e value drastically!

_isn't the null hypothesis just two theta being equal?_

### Correct data input for large block size (na, nb)

In the case of all 1s, nb = 100 and data sequence of 10, should the data be

```r
nb <- 100
# all 1s
rep(1, nData)

rep(1, nData * nb)

data <- matrix(1, nrow = nb, ncol = nData)
```
