## Goals

* [ ] How comes the eq. 2.3 in Yunda's k-sample paper, i.e. is the pseudo just the average?
* [ ] LONG: formulate and proof why power of e-variable goes to 1 as $n \to \infty$
* [ ] 


```math
\mu = (\mu_1, \mu_2, \cdots, \mu_k) \in \mathcal{M} \\

\langle \mu_0 \rangle = (\mu_0, \mu_0, \cdots, \mu_0) \in M^k \\

```

$\mathcal{M}$ is the parameters space for $\mu$

$M$ is a element in $\mathcal{M}$

Solve:

```math
\mu^*_0 = \arg\min_{\mu \in M} KL(P_{\mu} \parallel P_{\langle \mu_0 \rangle})
```
