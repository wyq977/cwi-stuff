## Goals

## Discussion with Tyron Wednesday

DG be the description gain $D(P \Vert Q \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{C})$

* [x] what is the case when the KL is infinite and DG is not? (Example 1)

DG is zero with 2 single prob. dist.

$P$ is standard Cauchy, $\mathcal{C} = \{Q\}$ (standard Gaussian).

```math
\begin{align*}
D(P \Vert Q \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{C}) 
&= \sup_{Q' \in \mathcal{C}} D(P \Vert Q \rightsquigarrow Q') \\
&= D(P \Vert Q \rightsquigarrow Q) \quad (\text{since $Q$ is a singleton}) \\
&= D(P \Vert Q) - D(P \Vert Q) \\
&= \infty - \infty = 0
\end{align*}
```

Extension to composite

$\mathcal{C} = \{\mathcal{N(\mu, 1)} \mid \mu \in [-1, 1]\}$

Between $P$ and any element in $\mathcal{C}$, the KL is still infinity.

?? By prop. 3 the uniform mixture of $\mathcal{C}$ ?? Then the redefined RIPr is 0??

What does $P \ll Q_i$ mean? Absolutely continuous?

### Example 2:

* [ ] Prop. 2: why the DG smaller that infinity, then it must be 
0, Implications for Prop. 3
* [ ] I don't know what does it mean to have DG equals to infinity

I guess the difference lies in the metric space we define??

### Proof of Prop. 2

Where does the last line comes form?

### Thm. 3

What does this inf mean in the statement


```math
\inf_{Q \in \mathcal{C}} D(P \Vert Q \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{C})
= \inf_{Q \in \mathcal{C}} \sup_{Q' \in \mathcal{C}} D(P \Vert Q) - D(P \Vert Q')
= \inf_{Q \in \mathcal{C}} D(P \Vert Q) - \inf_{Q' \in \mathcal{C}} D(P \Vert Q')
```

It seems wrong my writing
